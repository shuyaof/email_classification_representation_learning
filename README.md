# Email classification and image representation learning
In this repository, I am showcasing my project that integrates SpamHam email classification along with deep learning image analysis, leveraging the prowess of neural networks. I've ventured into the realms of cybersecurity and computer vision to create a tool that is not only potent but streamlined and adaptive.

Through my initiative, I planned to enhance email safety by accurately identifying spam and ham emails, and to push the boundaries of image recognition technology through deep learning.
